## Features

- **Manual and Automated Posting:**
  - Manual mode: Admin can trigger posting with a command (`/post`).
  - Automated mode: Bot checks for new links every 5 minutes and posts if a new link is found.

- **Admin Controls:**
  - `/start` â€“ Start the bot (admin only)
  - `/help` â€“ List admin commands
  - `/post` â€“ Scrape and post the latest Canva link (manual mode)
  - `/lastlink` â€“ Show the last posted link
  - `/logs` â€“ Get the last 20 lines of important logs (in code style)
  - `/health` â€“ Check if the bot is running
  - `/restart` â€“ Restart the bot server

- **Error Handling:**
  - All errors and important events are logged to `important.log` and sent to the adminâ€™s DM.
  - Log files are auto-truncated to prevent unlimited growth.

- **Health Check:**
  - HTTP server on port 8080 for deployment health checks.

## How It Works

- The bot scrapes the "Download" button from the target page and follows redirects to extract the latest Canva Pro invite link.
- It keeps track of the last posted link to avoid duplicates.
- Admin can manually trigger posting or check logs/status at any time.
